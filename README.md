This work is for a research project in Professor Michel Maharbiz's lab under the guidance of Tom Zajdel at UC Berkeley. The goal of the project was to develop a biosensor using chemotactic e. Coli as the sensing agent. 

During the process of developing the bioseonsor, many tests were conducted under a microscope to visualize how e. Coli bacteria react to differect concentrations of liquids they were immersed in. The test videos were recorded and the scripts in this repo were used to analyze whether liquid concentrations could be predicted by studying the bacteria's motor bias or rotation speed.
